This code is an exmaple of using the Drupal 7 [Migrate module's](https://drupal.org/project/migrate) API to import data into Drupal. The example here is used in the [Drupalize.Me](http://drupalize.me) series on Migrate module.

Each branch in this repository represents the code written during a specific lesson in the video series and reflects that state of the code at the end of that lesson. While helpful on it's own as an example of how to write a migration the demonsration really shines in conjunction with the videos.
